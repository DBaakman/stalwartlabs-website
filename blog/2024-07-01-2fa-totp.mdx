We are happy to announce the release of [Stalwart Mail Server](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server) 0.8.3! This latest version introduces two powerful security features: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with TOTP codes and Application Passwords. These additions are designed to enhance the security of your email accounts, providing robust protection against unauthorized access.

### Two-Factor Authentication

[Two-Factor Authentication](/docs/auth/2fa) (2FA) is a security measure that requires users to provide two forms of identification before gaining access to their accounts. With the introduction of TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) codes in Stalwart Mail Server 0.8.3, users can now benefit from this extra layer of security. TOTP codes are time-sensitive, one-time passwords generated by an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

When 2FA is enabled, users must enter their regular password and a TOTP code generated by their authenticator app. This ensures that even if an attacker obtains the user's password, they would still need the TOTP code to access the account, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. The TOTP codes are easy to set up and use, making them a convenient yet highly effective security measure.

### Application Passwords

Alongside 2FA, Stalwart Mail Server 0.8.3 introduces [Application Passwords](/docs/auth/app-password). These are unique, randomly generated passwords that allow users to access their email accounts on devices or applications that do not support the `OAUTHBEARER` SASL mechanism. Application Passwords are particularly useful for older mail clients, third-party applications, and automated scripts that need access to email accounts but cannot handle the interactive authentication required by 2FA.

By generating an Application Password, users can maintain access to their email accounts on all their devices and applications while still benefiting from the enhanced security of 2FA. These passwords are managed through the self-service portal, where users can create, view, and revoke them as needed.

### Improved Security, Enhanced Usability

The addition of Two-Factor Authentication with TOTP codes and Application Passwords in Stalwart Mail Server 0.8.3 represents a significant step forward in email account security. These features provide robust protection against unauthorized access, ensuring that your email communications remain secure. At the same time, they offer flexibility and ease of use, making it simple for users to secure their accounts without compromising on convenience.

We are committed to continuously improving the security and functionality of Stalwart Mail Server. We encourage all users to upgrade to version 0.8.3 and take advantage of these powerful new security features. As always, we welcome your feedback and look forward to hearing how these enhancements benefit you.

Stay secure, stay connected.
