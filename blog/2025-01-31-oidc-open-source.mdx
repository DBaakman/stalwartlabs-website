We are happy to announce that third-party **OpenID Connect** (OIDC) authentication support has now been open-sourced under the AGPL-3.0 license in [Stalwart Mail Server](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server) version `0.11.5`. This means that users can now configure Stalwart Mail Server to authenticate against external OIDC providers, such as Keycloak, without requiring an Enterprise subscription.

Stalwart Mail Server has supported OIDC authentication for several months, allowing it to function as either an OIDC provider or an OIDC client authenticating against an external provider. Until now, only the ability to act as an OIDC provider was included in the Open Source edition, while authentication via external OIDC providers was reserved for Enterprise users. By making this functionality freely available, we are reinforcing our commitment to openness and ensuring that more users can take advantage of modern, federated authentication without barriers.

With this change, organizations that rely on external OIDC identity providers can seamlessly integrate Stalwart Mail Server into their existing authentication workflows at no cost. Whether you are using Keycloak, Auth0, or another OIDC-compliant solution, Stalwart Mail Server now offers complete flexibility in how you manage authentication.

## Why is Stalwart Not 100% Free?

At Stalwart Labs, our goal is to provide a robust and feature-rich mail server solution. However, sustaining long-term development for a project of this scale requires significant financial resources. At present, open-source sponsorships alone do not generate sufficient funding to cover these costs entirely.

To ensure that Stalwart Mail Server continues to evolve and improve, we offer a paid Enterprise version. Revenue from Enterprise subscriptions allows our team to dedicate full-time efforts to development, ensuring the continuous enhancement of both the open-source and paid versions. This funding model allows us to introduce new features while maintaining the high standards that make Stalwart Mail Server a leading solution in the industry.

Furthermore, the existence of an Enterprise edition directly benefits the open-source community. By sustaining active development, we can periodically release new features into the open-source version, as we have done with third-party OIDC support. It is worth noting that even the community edition of Stalwart Mail Server already provides more features than any other open-source or commercial mail server available today. We are dedicated to maintaining and expanding this competitive edge.

If you would like to support open-source development and help accelerate the release of additional features as open-source, we invite you to become a sponsor. Your sponsorship plays a vital role in the project's sustainability and future growth. Thank you for your support and understanding.
