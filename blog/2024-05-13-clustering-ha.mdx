We are excited to announce the release of Stalwart Mail Server v0.8.0, a significant update that introduces powerful new features and enhancements designed to improve performance, scalability, and ease of use. This release marks a major step forward in our commitment to providing a robust and highly available email server solution for businesses and organizations of all sizes.

### Enhanced Clustering Capabilities

A major highlight of this release is the introduction of advanced clustering support, a feature aimed at enterprises needing high availability and fault tolerance in their email services. The new clustering functionality includes node auto-discovery, which simplifies the scaling process by automatically detecting and integrating new nodes into the existing cluster. Additionally, our enhanced partition-tolerant failure detection ensures that the system remains robust and operational even when network partitions occur. These features collectively enhance the resilience of the mail server, ensuring continuous service availability and reliability.

### Simplified Email Client Configuration

Stalwart v0.8.0 also brings support for Autoconfig and Autodiscover protocols, which are essential for streamlining the user experience. These protocols automate the configuration process for email clients, eliminating the need for manual setup and reducing the potential for errors. By supporting these standards, Stalwart makes it easier for users to connect their email clients to the server, promoting a seamless integration with a variety of platforms.

### Performance and Storage Optimizations

We have implemented significant performance improvements, particularly in our integration with FoundationDB, enhancing the speed and efficiency of our database interactions. This version also introduces improved full-text indexing, which now uses less disk space without compromising search capabilities. These optimizations ensure that Stalwart Mail Server can handle larger volumes of data more efficiently, making it ideal for organizations with high email traffic.

### Security and Administration Enhancements

Stalwart v0.8.0 enhances security measures by automatically publishing MTA-STS policies and generating TLSA records for DANE, providing an additional layer of security by enabling encrypted email transport. These features help in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure that email communications are secured at transit.

Furthermore, this release includes a new feature in the web-admin panel that allows administrators to visualize queued messages. This tool is invaluable for monitoring and managing email flow, providing insights into the server's operational status and helping to quickly address delivery issues.

### Looking Forward

The release of Stalwart Mail Server v0.8.0 with its focus on clustering, autoconfiguration, and performance improvements demonstrates our ongoing commitment to developing cutting-edge technology that meets the needs of our users. We believe these enhancements will make a significant difference in how businesses and organizations manage their email infrastructures.

We invite you to download and experience the new features of Stalwart Mail Server v0.8.0. As always, we look forward to your feedback, which is crucial in helping us continue to improve and evolve our product to better serve you.
